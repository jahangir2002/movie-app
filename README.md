## ‚ú®Features

### üìà Trending Movies

Display a list of popular and trending movies fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

#### How It Works:

Fetching Data : On initial load, the application makes a request to the TMDb API to fetch the list of trending movies.

Display : The fetched movie data is displayed with movie posters and titles.

Update: The list of trending movies is periodically updated.

### ‚è± Search Functionality with Debouncing
Description:

Users can search for movies using a debounced input field to minimize API requests.

#### How It Works:

Debouncing: The useDebounce hook is used to delay the API request until the user has stopped typing for 500ms. This reduces the number of API requests and improves performance.

Fetching Data: The application fetches movie data based on the user's search query.

### üéû Dynamic Trending Movies
Description:

Trending movies are dynamically fetched from the Appwrite database.

#### How It Works:

Search Impact: When a user searches for a movie, the search count for that movie is updated in the Appwrite database.

Dynamic Update: If a searched movie becomes popular, it appears in the trending section.

Data Source: The application fetches both trending and all movies data from the API and the Appwrite database.

### üìùAdditional Notes:

The application ensures that the trending section is always up-to-date with the most popular searched movies.

Combining data from TMDb API and Appwrite provides a rich and dynamic user experience.
